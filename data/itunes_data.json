The horse's gruff owner Del Montgomery (Steve Buscemi) and his seasoned jockey Bonnie (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny) help Charley fill the void of his father's absence\u2014until he discovers that Pete is bound for slaughter, prompting him to take extreme measures to spare his new friend\u2019s life. Charley and Pete head out into the great unknown, embarking on an odyssey across the new American frontier in search of a loving aunt Charley hasn\u2019t seen in years. They experience adventure and heartbreak in equal measure, but never lose their irrepressible hope and resiliency as they pursue their dream of finding a place they can call home. Featuring an incredible breakout turn by Charlie Plummer (The Dinner, King Jack, All The Money in the World) and memorable supporting work by indie stalwarts Buscemi, Sevigny and Steve Zahn, Lean on Pete is a compassionate and heartrending look at the desire for love, family, and acceptance that drives all of us."}, {"wrapperType": "track", "kind": "feature-movie", "trackId": 1440560815, "artistName": "Jeremy Jones", "trackName": "Ode to Muir: The High Sierra", "trackCensoredName": "Ode to Muir: The High Sierra", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/ode-to-muir-the-high-sierra/id1440560815?uo=4", "previewUrl": "https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/apple-assets-us-std-000001/Video128/v4/f2/df/f9/f2dff9b3-7ebe-0aaa-408a-b588039e07ab/mzvf_3834678306334551489.640x480.h264lc.U.p.m4v", "artworkUrl30": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video118/v4/c5/ee/cc/c5eecc19-5254-2ebf-e56f-577cbc95be56/source/30x30bb.jpg", "artworkUrl60": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video118/v4/c5/ee/cc/c5eecc19-5254-2ebf-e56f-577cbc95be56/source/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video118/v4/c5/ee/cc/c5eecc19-5254-2ebf-e56f-577cbc95be56/source/100x100bb.jpg", "collectionPrice": 7.99, "trackPrice": 7.99, "trackRentalPrice": 4.99, "collectionHdPrice": 9.99, "trackHdPrice": 9.99, "trackHdRentalPrice": 4.99, "releaseDate": "2018-11-27T08:00:00Z", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackTimeMillis": 3490328, "country": "USA", "currency": "USD", "primaryGenreName": "Sports", "contentAdvisoryRating": "NR", "shortDescription": "Ode To Muir pairs professional snowboarder, adventurer and founder of Protect Our Winters, Jeremy", "longDescription": "Ode to Muir pairs professional snowboarder, adventurer and founder of Protect Our Winters, Jeremy Jones, with two-time Olympian, Elena Hight, as they embark on a 40-mile foot-powered expedition deep into California\u2019s John Muir Wilderness.

The story opens with a prologue in which a veteran brings his family to the American cemetery at Normandy, and a flashback then joins Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and GIs in a landing craft making the June 6, 1944, approach to Omaha Beach to face devastating German artillery fire. This mass slaughter of American soldiers is depicted in a compelling, unforgettable 24-minute sequence. Miller's men slowly move forward to finally take a concrete pillbox. On the beach littered with bodies is one with the name \"Ryan\" stenciled on his backpack. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell), learning that three Ryan brothers from the same family have all been killed in a single week, requests that the surviving brother, Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon), be located and brought back to the United States. Capt. Miller gets the assignment, and he chooses a translator, Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davis), skilled in language but not in combat, to join his squad of right-hand man Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore), plus privates Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), cynical Reiben (Edward Burns) from Brooklyn, Italian-American Caparzo (Vin Diesel), and religious Southerner Jackson (Barry Pepper), an ace sharpshooter who calls on the Lord while taking aim. Having previously experienced action in Italy and North Africa, the close-knit squad sets out through areas still thick with Nazis. After they lose one man in a skirmish at a bombed village, some in the group begin to question the logic of losing more lives to save a single soldier. The film's historical consultant is Stephen E. Ambrose, and the incident is based on a true occurance in Ambrose's 1994 bestseller D-Day: June 6, 1944.", "hasITunesExtras": true}, {"wrapperType": "track", "kind": "feature-movie", "collectionId": 776972828, "trackId": 284563157, "artistName": "Martin Scorsese", "collectionName": "Scorsese 6 Film Collection", "trackName": "The Departed", "collectionCensoredName": "Scorsese 6 Film Collection", "trackCensoredName": "The Departed", "collectionArtistId": 199257486, "collectionArtistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/warner-bros-entertainment-inc/199257486?uo=4", "collectionViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-departed/id284563157?uo=4", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-departed/id284563157?uo=4", "previewUrl": "https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/apple-assets-us-std-000001/Video118/v4/d8/d6/7e/d8d67e9f-ed48-a9b4-4c8f-061bbb703421/mzvf_6012093280064151573.640x480.h264lc.U.p.m4v", "artworkUrl30": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video4/v4/f8/77/63/f877631d-8832-4633-d3a8-e20a01d53aa3/source/30x30bb.jpg", "artworkUrl60": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video4/v4/f8/77/63/f877631d-8832-4633-d3a8-e20a01d53aa3/source/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video4/v4/f8/77/63/f877631d-8832-4633-d3a8-e20a01d53aa3/source/100x100bb.jpg", "collectionPrice": 14.99, "trackPrice": 14.99, "trackRentalPrice": 3.99, "collectionHdPrice": 14.99, "trackHdPrice": 14.99, "trackHdRentalPrice": 3.99, "releaseDate": "2006-12-07T08:00:00Z", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "discCount": 1, "discNumber": 1, "trackCount": 6, "trackNumber": 1, "trackTimeMillis": 9079047, "country": "USA", "currency": "USD", "primaryGenreName": "Drama", "contentAdvisoryRating": "R", "longDescription": "Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg star in Martin Scorsese's new crime drama \"The Departed.\" \"The Departed\" is set in South Boston where the state police force is waging an all-out war to take down the city's top organized crime ring.

The pair lived on the sheer vertical cliff for weeks, igniting a frenzy of global media attention. But for Tommy Caldwell, the Dawn Wall was much more than just a climb. It was the culmination of a lifetime defined by overcoming obstacles. At the age of 22, the climbing prodigy was taken hostage by rebels in Kyrgyzstan. Shortly after, he lost his index finger in an accident, but resolved to come back stronger. When his marriage fell apart, he escaped the pain by fixating on the extraordinary goal of free climbing the Dawn Wall.

Directed by Spielberg, Disney\u2019s \u201cThe BFG\u201d tells the imaginative story of a young girl and the Giant who introduces her to the wonders and perils of Giant Country. The BFG (Mark Rylance), while a giant himself, is a Big Friendly Giant and nothing like the other inhabitants of Giant Country. Standing 24-feet tall with enormous ears and a keen sense of smell, he is endearingly dim-witted and keeps to himself for the most part. Giants like Bloodbottler (Bill Hader) and Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) on the other hand, are twice as big and at least twice as scary and have been known to eat humans, while the BFG prefers Snozzcumber and Frobscottle. Upon her arrival in Giant Country, Sophie, a precocious 10-year-old girl from London, is initially frightened of the mysterious giant who has brought her to his cave, but soon comes to realize that the BFG is actually quite gentle and charming, and, having never met a giant before, has many questions. The BFG brings Sophie to Dream Country where he collects dreams and sends them to children, teaching her all about the magic and mystery of dreams.

As they confront unthinkable odds together, the four men find reserves of strength and resilience as they stay in the fight to the finish. Mark Wahlberg stars as Marcus Luttrell, the author of the first-person memoir \u201cLone Survivor,\u201d whose book has become a motivational resource for its lessons on how the power of the human spirit is tested when we are pushed beyond our mental and physical limits. Starring alongside Wahlberg as the other members of the SEAL team are Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster.

The pair lived on the sheer vertical cliff for weeks, igniting a frenzy of global media attention. But for Tommy Caldwell, the Dawn Wall was much more than just a climb. It was the culmination of a lifetime defined by overcoming obstacles. At the age of 22, the climbing prodigy was taken hostage by rebels in Kyrgyzstan. Shortly after, he lost his index finger in an accident, but resolved to come back stronger. When his marriage fell apart, he escaped the pain by fixating on the extraordinary goal of free climbing the Dawn Wall.

That is until fast-talking, slow thinking police patrolman and wannabe actor, Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy) manages to botch the entire operation. Furious at the outcome and aggravated by the television crews at the scene, Mitch shoots at a camera. Instantly he becomes a media celebrity and catches the eye of reality TV producer, Chase Renzi (Rene Russo). Knowing the police need some positive PR, she sells the benefits of a crew following Mitch and Trey around to the Chief of Police. He agrees and instead of giving Mitch a suspension, he gives him an ultimatum: do it for the camera's or don't do it at all. It's not going to be pretty, but it's going to be fun, when real cop Mitch is thrown into the unreal world of television complete with phony people, bad sets and a partner who would rather act a cop then be one!

Gerson asks Frank to help but Frank still holds a grudge. But after some prodding he agrees but only if he and his team can go there so he can fix it.

A powerful story based on one family's survival of the 2004 tsunami, THE IMPOSSIBLE stars Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor and is directed by J.A. Bayona (THE ORPHANAGE). Maria (Naomi Watts), Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three sons begin their winter vacation in Thailand, looking forward to a few days in tropical paradise. But on the morning of December 26th, as the family relaxes around the pool after their Christmas festivities the night before, a terrifying roar rises up from the center of the earth. As Maria freezes in fear, a huge wall of black water races across the hotel grounds toward her.

Directed by Spielberg, Disney\u2019s \u201cThe BFG\u201d tells the imaginative story of a young girl and the Giant who introduces her to the wonders and perils of Giant Country. The BFG (Mark Rylance), while a giant himself, is a Big Friendly Giant and nothing like the other inhabitants of Giant Country. Standing 24-feet tall with enormous ears and a keen sense of smell, he is endearingly dim-witted and keeps to himself for the most part. Giants like Bloodbottler (Bill Hader) and Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) on the other hand, are twice as big and at least twice as scary and have been known to eat humans, while the BFG prefers Snozzcumber and Frobscottle. Upon her arrival in Giant Country, Sophie, a precocious 10-year-old girl from London, is initially frightened of the mysterious giant who has brought her to his cave, but soon comes to realize that the BFG is actually quite gentle and charming, and, having never met a giant before, has many questions. The BFG brings Sophie to Dream Country where he collects dreams and sends them to children, teaching her all about the magic and mystery of dreams. Having both been on their own in the world up until now, their affection for one another quickly grows, but Sophie\u2019s presence in Giant Country has attracted the unwanted attention of the other giants, who have become increasingly more bothersome. Sophie and the BFG soon depart for London to see the Queen (Penelope Wilton) and warn her of the precarious giant situation, but they must first convince the Queen and her maid, Mary (Rebecca Hall), that giants do indeed exist.

Giants like Bloodbottler (Bill Hader) and Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) on the other hand, are twice as big and at least twice as scary and have been known to eat humans, while the BFG prefers Snozzcumber and Frobscottle. Upon her arrival in Giant Country, Sophie, a precocious 10-year-old girl from London, is initially frightened of the mysterious giant who has brought her to his cave, but soon comes to realize that the BFG is actually quite gentle and charming, and, having never met a giant before, has many questions. The BFG brings Sophie to Dream Country where he collects dreams and sends them to children, teaching her all about the magic and mystery of dreams. Having both been on their own in the world up until now, their affection for one another quickly grows, but Sophie\u2019s presence in Giant Country has attracted the unwanted attention of the other giants, who have become increasingly more bothersome. Sophie and the BFG soon depart for London to see the Queen (Penelope Wilton) and warn her of the precarious giant situation, but they must first convince the Queen and her maid, Mary (Rebecca Hall), that giants do indeed exist.

The festivities are disrupted when Mason\u2019s best friend, CIA Agent Cal Riley arrives with startling information about Karim. Seconds later, terrorists attack the party with tragic results. Ten years later, Mason, now an alcoholic working as a mediator for labor disputes in Boston, gets approached by a stranger in a bar, who hands him a passport, cash and a plane ticket along with an urgent invitation from mutual \"friends\" that he travel to Beirut. Reluctantly, Mason arrives in Beirut only to find that the formerly picturesque city on the sea has become a violence-ridden warzone. Mason soon discovers the real reason he\u2019s been called back. CIA and Embassy officials Donald Gaines, Gary Ruzak, and Ambassador Frank Whalen explain that terrorists have kidnapped a CIA agent.

But Hal's humanity is one weapon no member of the Corps has ever had, and if--with willpower, determination and the encouragement of fellow pilot and childhood sweetheart Carol Ferris (Blake Lively)--Hal can quickly master his new powers and find the courage to overcome his fears, he will save the Earth and all of mankind from certain destruction."}, {"wrapperType": "track", "kind": "feature-movie", "trackId": 271991087, "artistName": "James Cameron", "trackName": "The Terminator", "trackCensoredName": "The Terminator", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/the-terminator/id271991087?uo=4", "previewUrl": "https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/apple-assets-us-std-000001/Video118/v4/56/45/78/564578c5-6aef-873a-fda6-31b57bb7a69b/mzvf_5386172920251510773.640x460.h264lc.U.p.m4v", "artworkUrl30": "https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video69/v4/f5/6b/ea/f56bea07-db30-9f80-858e-8cfa4783bf61/source/30x30bb.jpg", "artworkUrl60": "https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video69/v4/f5/6b/ea/f56bea07-db30-9f80-858e-8cfa4783bf61/source/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video69/v4/f5/6b/ea/f56bea07-db30-9f80-858e-8cfa4783bf61/source/100x100bb.jpg", "collectionPrice": 13.99, "trackPrice": 13.99, "trackRentalPrice": 5.99, "collectionHdPrice": 14.99, "trackHdPrice": 14.99, "trackHdRentalPrice": 5.99, "releaseDate": "1984-10-26T07:00:00Z", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackTimeMillis": 6448697, "country": "NZL", "currency": "NZD", "primaryGenreName": "Sci-Fi & Fantasy", "contentAdvisoryRating": "M", "longDescription": "A cyborg (part man, part machine) is sent from the 21st century to present-day Los Angeles to assassinate a seemingly innocent women whose child will play an important part in the world from which the killer came.", "hasITunesExtras": true}, {"wrapperType": "track", "kind": "feature-movie", "collectionId": 1308467473, "trackId": 262769431, "artistName": "Wayne Wang", "collectionName": "Romance Movie Collection", "trackName": "Last Holiday", "collectionCensoredName": "Romance Movie Collection", "trackCensoredName": "Last Holiday", "collectionArtistId": 1008915738, "collectionArtistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/nz/artist/paramount-home-entertainment-inc/1008915738?uo=4", "collectionViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/last-holiday/id262769431?uo=4", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/last-holiday/id262769431?uo=4", "previewUrl": "https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/apple-assets-us-std-000001/Video/9c/f6/46/mzm.qlgpgqxi..640x480.h264lc.d2.p.m4v", "artworkUrl30": "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/v4/fb/33/20/fb332002-146f-0f12-f744-bd4d841e468e/source/30x30bb.jpg", "artworkUrl60": "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/v4/fb/33/20/fb332002-146f-0f12-f744-bd4d841e468e/source/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/v4/fb/33/20/fb332002-146f-0f12-f744-bd4d841e468e/source/100x100bb.jpg", "collectionPrice": 7.99, "trackPrice": 7.99, "trackRentalPrice": 5.99, "collectionHdPrice": 10.99, "trackHdPrice": 10.99, "trackHdRentalPrice": 5.99, "releaseDate": "2006-05-02T07:00:00Z", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "discCount": 1, "discNumber": 1, "trackCount": 5, "trackNumber": 2, "trackTimeMillis": 6695542, "country": "NZL", "currency": "NZD", "primaryGenreName": "Comedy", "contentAdvisoryRating": "PG", "longDescription": "Enjoy yourself ... it's later than you think!

A powerful story based on one family's survival of the 2004 tsunami, THE IMPOSSIBLE stars Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor and is directed by J.A. Bayona (THE ORPHANAGE). Maria (Naomi Watts), Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three sons begin their winter vacation in Thailand, looking forward to a few days in tropical paradise. But on the morning of December 26th, as the family relaxes around the pool after their Christmas festivities the night before, a terrifying roar rises up from the center of the earth. As Maria freezes in fear, a huge wall of black water races across the hotel grounds toward her.
