# Movie Data #

In this project, I'll be analysing data from:

1.	[iTunes RSS Feed and iTunes Search API](#itunes)
2.	[Open Movie Database](#omdb)
3.	[Box Office Mojo](#mojo)

<h2> <a name="itunes"> iTunes Data </a></h2>

The data comes from the iTunes store, where I've collected data from the iTunes RSS feed and iTunes Search API. You can follow my data collection process through my Github repository and README. I've collected a total of 1,800 of the latest and most popular movies on iTunes across 9 different countries. These are mainly countries in the APAC market, ie. Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, The Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. I've also included movies from the US iTunes store.

This is a description of the major data fields that I'll be focusing on in my analysis. There are other features within the data that I'll be excluding from the analysis but these can be viewed from the [iTunes API documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/UnderstandingSearchResults.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH8-SW1).

<h2><a name="omdb"> Open Movie Database </a></h2>

The OMdb data has two main components. The search parameters contained in the OMdb_search_dat JSON file, which contain the keyword search strings and IMdb IDs used to query the OMdb API. Crucially, each search string and unique IMdb ID contains a corresponding unique iTunes ID, which will then be used to join the iTunes data and the OMdb data.

The OMdb_data JSON file contains the results that have come back from the OMdb API. These contain information on the movie, including information on the cast, box office returns, critic ratings etc. 

In my analysis, I'll be joining the two data files into a common dataframe. I've listed the definitions of most of the features below but please check in with the [OMdb API documentation](http://www.omdbapi.com/) for further reference.
